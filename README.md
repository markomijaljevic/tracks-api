Python task
==================

Create a small Python application that provides a REST API of the provided JSON data. You may use any framework or libraries (or none).

The API should allow a client to perform the following:

- Fetch a single track
- Create a new track
- List the first 100 most recently played tracks (most recent first)
- Filter tracks by name

Bonus:

- Allow the client to fetch a list of artists. Each result should contain artist name, the total number of tracks for that artist and their most recently played track.

We're looking to assess general Python ability and familiarity with APIs - there's no need to set up a production grade stack or account for real-world security/error handling.
